# upgrade.sh - bump the FTXUI dependency to a newer release.
#
#   ./upgrade.sh              upgrade to the latest FTXUI release on GitHub
#   ./upgrade.sh <tag>        pin a specific tag, e.g. ./upgrade.sh v5.0.0
#
# What it does:
#   - reads the current pin from CMakeLists.txt.in (the template build.sh uses)
#   - updates it to the chosen/latest tag
#   - clears the cached FetchContent checkouts so the new tag is actually used
#   - runs a configure pass to fetch the new tag and verify the local patch
#     (patches/ftxui-c0-delivery.patch) still applies; on failure it rolls
#     the template back to the previous pin
#
# FTXUI upgrades can break the app compile if its API changed - configure
# passing here only means the patch applied; then run ./build.sh.
